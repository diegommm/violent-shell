# [codegolf] violent-shell
Things that (most-likely) should not exist. I wrote this not "because I can", but "because I shouldn't". And to make a point that you should use a proper programming language sometimes instead of abusing the use case of shell scripting. And because I had this idea and I have OCD, so also I wasn't able to stop it. Sorryn't.
